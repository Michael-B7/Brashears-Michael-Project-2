                <h2>Solar Info</h2>
                <p>Solar panels absorb the energy from the Sun and convert it into electricity. They do this by having a semiconductor, a material that has an electrical conductivity that falls between a conductor, like copper, and an insulator, like glass, which is hit by the photons from the sun and releases electrons, generating electricity. <a href="panels.html">Read More</a></p>

            <h2>Environmental Impact</h2>
            <p>Although, in the long run, solar panels are better for the environment than other energy producers like fossil fuels and natural gas, there are still environmental concerns associated with solar panels. These concerns come from the manufacturing process and transport of the solar panels. These are the top contributors of carbon emissions from solar panels, which are offset by the clean energy produced after. <a href="environment.html">Read More</a></p>

                <h2>Savings</h2>
                <p>The expensive materials and manufacturing techniques used in solar panels cause the somewhat high cost of them. This cost is offset by the reduction to your energy bill though. The cost of solar panel installation is paid back to the consumer through energy bill reductions in seven to eight years, after this, the solar panels are saving you money for completely free for the rest of their life span, which averages 25 to 30 years.</p>

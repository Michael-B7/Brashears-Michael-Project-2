        <h2>Solar Info</h2>
        <p>Solar panels absorb the energy from the Sun and convert it into electricity. They do this by having a semiconductor, a material that has an electrical conductivity that falls between a conductor, like copper, and an insulator, like glass, which is hit by the photons from the sun and releases electrons, generating electricity. <a href="panels.html">Read More</a></p>
